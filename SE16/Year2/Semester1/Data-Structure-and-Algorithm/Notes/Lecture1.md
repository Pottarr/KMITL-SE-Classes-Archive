# Chapter 1: Introduction

> Data Structures + Algorithms = Program

## Data VS Information

- Data = Fact  
- Information = Processed Fact

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Therefore, Data = Raw Fact and after being processed it becomes Information.

> [!NOTE]  
> In this course Computer is just refer to Hardware being used in the process.

### Basic Data Operations (CRUD)

- C $\rightarrow$ Create $\rightarrow$ POST request
- E $\rightarrow$ Retrieve $\rightarrow$ GET request
- C $\rightarrow$ Update $\rightarrow$ PUT request
- C $\rightarrow$ Create $\rightarrow$ DELETE request

> Algorithm is just like a way to achieve a certain goal.

## Abstact Data Types

We abstact a basic Data Structure to create new Data Structures.

Abstact = Hide the detail

### List Abstract Data Types

- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Tree
- Graph
