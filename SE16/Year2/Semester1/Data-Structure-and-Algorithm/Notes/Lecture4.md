# Linked List

Problems of Array

- Suppose we storing 1,000,000 integers (32bit or 4Byte each) $\therefore$ 4 MB of contigual memory in RAM which is almost impossible.

## LinkedList methods

### `.add(x)`

## Drawbacks of LinkedList

- It doesn't have `index`.

## Circular LinkedList (In Java Doubly Linked List)

> Shallow Copy -> A copy that still share data
> Deep Copy -> A NEW copy that have nothing to do with the original one

Benefit of Deep Copy: You can do whatever you want to the data without
interfering with the original data.
