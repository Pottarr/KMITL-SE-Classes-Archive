\section*{Homework of Conditional Probability}

\subsection*{Question 1}

With respect of Example 1.16, consider the priori probability model\\

\noindent $P[rr] = 0.01, P[ra] = 0.01, P[ar] = 0.01, P[aa] = 0.97$.\\

\noindent Let $B$ denote the event that the first chip tested image
rejected and similiarly, let denote $A$ the event that the second
circuit is a failure.\\

\noindent Find $P[{A}^{c}|B]$ and $P[{A}^{c}|{B}^{c}]$

\subsection*{Solution}

From the information given by the question, we know that

\begin{multicols}{2} \notag

\begin{align}
P[A] & = P[rr] + P[ar] \\
& = 0.01 + 0.01 \\
& = 0.02 \\
\\
P[B] & = P[rr] + P[ra] \\
& = 0.01 + 0.01 \\
& = 0.02 \\
\\
P[{A}^{c}B] & = P[ra] \\
& = 0.01 \\
\\
\therefore P[{A}^{c}|{B}] & = \frac{P[{A}^{c}B]}{P[B]} \\
& = \frac{0.01}{0.02} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\
\\
\end{align}

\columnbreak

\begin{align}
P[{A}^{c}] & = P[aa] + P[ar] \\
& = 0.01 + 0.01 \\
& = 0.02 \\
\\
P[{B}^{c}] & = P[aa] + P[ar] \\
& = 0.97 + 0.01 \\
& 0.98 \\
\\
P[{A}^{c}{B}^{c}] & = P[aa] \\
& = 0.97 \\
\\
\therefore P[{A}^{c}|{B}] & = \frac{P[{A}^{c}{B}^{c}]}{P[{B}^{c}]} \\
& = \frac{0.97}{0.98} \\
\\
\end{align}

\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Question 2}

Two manufacturing plants produce similar parts. Plant 1 produces 1,000
parts, 100 of which are defective. Plant 2 produces 2,000 parts, 150
of which are defective. A part is selected at random and found to be
defective. What is the probability that it came from plant 1?
(Hint: Let B be the event that "the part selected is defective," and
let A be the event that "gthe part selected came from plant 1." Find
$P[A|B]$)

\subsection*{Solution}

From the information given by the question, we know that

\begin{equation} \notag
\begin{split}
P[A] & = \frac{parts\ produced\ from\ plant\ 1}{all\ part\ from\ both\ plants} \\
& = \frac{100}{3000} \\
\\
P[B] & = \frac{all\ defected\ parts}{all\ parts\ from\ both\ plants} \\
& = \frac{250}{3000} \\
\\
P[AB] & = \frac{parts\ from\ plant\ 1\ and\ defected}{all\ parts\ from\ both\ plants} \\
& = \frac{100}{3000} \\
\\
\therefore P[A|B] & = \frac{P[AB]}{P[B]} \\ & = \frac{\frac{100}{3000}}{\frac{250}{3000}} = \frac{100}{250} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Answer}
$\therefore$ The probability of getting parts produced in plant 1 where
randomly inspect where the part is defective is equal to $0.4$
