# Lecture 5: Memory

## ECC (Error Check and Correction) VS Parity Check

- Parity Check can check only when the 1 bit of data is broken bit ECC can do more

## Why need Memory Mangement?

- For example, to make sure 2 or more programs not fighting for the same address
- To make sure the virtual memory of program is not pointing to th non existed address
- To make sure for multiple programs not overlapping addresses

## Three Memory Problems

- Not enough RAM
- Holes in the our addresses space
- Programs writing over each other

## Virtual Address VS Physical Address Definition

## Paging

## Objective

- Know how to use Page in and Page out in memory
- Benefits and drawbacks of DMA
